# Fraud Detection SQL Project

## 1. Background and Overview of the Dataset

The Synthetic Financial Datasets for Fraud Detection is designed to simulate a variety of transactions, some of which are fraudulent. The dataset contains detailed records of transactions between accounts, including attributes such as transaction type, amount, account balances before and after transactions, and flags indicating fraudulent activity. This dataset is particularly useful for developing and testing fraud detection algorithms and for conducting exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior.

## 2. Data Structure Overview

The dataset consists of the following key columns:

•	step: Represents the time of the transaction.

•	nameOrig: The identifier of the originating account.

•	nameDest: The identifier of the destination account.

•	amount: The transaction amount.

•	oldbalanceOrg: The balance of the originating account before the transaction.

•	newbalanceOrig: The balance of the originating account after the transaction.

•	oldbalanceDest: The balance of the destination account before the transaction.

•	newbalanceDest: The balance of the destination account after the transaction.

•	isFraud: A flag indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent.

•	isFlaggedFraud: A flag indicating whether the transaction has been flagged for fraud.

## 3. Executive Summary

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions within the dataset by employing SQL queries to analyze transaction patterns and account behaviors. The analysis utilizes Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to execute complex queries, allowing for recursive fraud detection, temporal analysis of fraudulent activities, and validation of account balances post-transactions. The findings reveal significant insights into account behaviors that may indicate potential fraudulent activities.

## 4. Insights Deep Dive

The analysis yielded several important insights:

#### •	Fraudulent Chains: 
Using recursive CTEs, we identified chains of transactions that suggest money laundering activities, with multiple transfers between accounts flagged as fraudulent.

#### •	Temporal Fraud Patterns: 
The rolling sum of fraudulent transactions over time highlighted specific accounts with a surge in suspicious activity, suggesting that certain accounts may be used repeatedly for fraudulent transfers.

#### •	Complex Fraud Detection: 
By cross-referencing accounts with large transfers, consecutive transactions without balance changes, and flagged transactions, we pinpointed accounts exhibiting suspicious behaviors that warrant further investigation.

#### •	Data Integrity Validation: 
The comparison between computed and actual balances uncovered discrepancies that could indicate errors in transaction records or potential fraud, reinforcing the importance of accurate financial data management.

## 5. Recommendations

Based on the insights gained from the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

#### •	Implement Enhanced Monitoring: 
Establish a system for real-time monitoring of accounts that frequently engage in large transfers or exhibit unusual transaction patterns. This can help in promptly identifying potential fraud.

#### •	Regular Audits of Transactions: 
Conduct periodic audits of transaction records, especially for accounts flagged by queries that reveal discrepancies between computed and actual balances. This will enhance data integrity and reduce the risk of fraud.

#### •	Fraud Detection Algorithms: 
Consider integrating machine learning algorithms that can automatically flag transactions based on historical data patterns. The insights from this project can serve as a foundation for developing such algorithms.

#### •	User Education: 
Educate account holders on safe transaction practices and the importance of monitoring their accounts for unauthorized activity. Increasing awareness can help in early detection of potential fraud.

#### •	Collaboration with Regulatory Bodies: 
Collaborate with financial regulatory authorities to develop better frameworks for reporting and investigating fraudulent activities, leveraging insights from data analyses.
